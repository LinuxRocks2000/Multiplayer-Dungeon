# Multiplayer-Dungeon
Top-down browser-based multiplayer dungeon game. If you want to host it, you'll need NodeJS and the WS package. I won't explain how to install them here, if you're that new to coding and want to learn via game editing you should probably start by remixing Platformer (https://linuxrocks2000.github.io/platformer/platformer-game/index.html), a much simpler game.
